**Users** [Who/what will call/use this component?]

**Kind** [Function | Struct | Module | Crate | Database etc]

**Location** [Which file/class/module/crate will this new component be located in?]

**Details**
> Use pseudo-code or type notation to describe the structure.

```
[details]
```

**Requirements References**
- [feature-name:FR-001]: [Why this requirement necessitates this component]
- [feature-name:NFR-001]: [Why this requirement necessitates this component]

**Test Scenarios**

**TS-XX: [Scenario name]**
- Given: [Initial state/context]
- When: [Action performed]
- Then: [Expected outcome]

---

## Used Components

> Existing components required as-is for implementation. Document what each provides and why it's needed.

### [Used Component 1]
**Location** [Path to component]

**Provides** [What functionality/interface this component offers that we depend on]

**Used By** [Which Modified/Added components depend on this]

---

## Documentation Considerations
- [Developer docs that need to be created/updated]
- [API docs that need to be created/updated]
- [Readme's docs that need to be created/updated]
- [Any other documentation considerations?]

---

## Instrumentation (optional)

> Only include if there are NFRs requiring observability. Skip for typical features.

- [Metric/log/trace to implement and which component]

---

## Integration Test Scenarios (if needed)

> Define scenarios that test interactions between multiple components. Each scenario should verify a complete user journey or system interaction.

**ITS-XX: [Scenario name]**
- Given: [Initial system state]
- When: [User action or trigger]
- Then: [Expected system behavior]
- Components Involved: [List of components]

---

## E2E Test Scenarios (if needed)

> Define end-to-end scenarios that test complete user workflows through the entire system. Each scenario should simulate real user behavior from start to finish.

**E2E-XX: [Scenario name]**
- Given: [Initial user/system state]
- When: [Complete user workflow]
- Then: [Final expected state]
- User Journey: [Steps in the journey]

---

## Test Data
- [Requirements and sources]

---

## Test Feasibility
- [Missing test infrastructure that should be built first]
- [Missing test data that should be acquired first]

---

## Risks and Dependencies
- [Technical risks and mitigation]
- [External dependencies]
- [Assumptions and constraints]

---

## Feasability Review
- [Large missing feature that needs to be built first as separate iteration]
- [Large missing infrastructure that needs to be available first as separate iteration]

---


## Task Breakdown

> **CRITICAL: Tests are written WITH implementation, not after.**
> Each task that adds or modifies functionality MUST include writing tests as part of that task.
> Do NOT create separate "Add tests" tasks or defer testing to later phases.
> TDD approach: Write failing test → Implement → Verify test passes → Refactor.

### Phase [X]: [Goal of this phase]

**Task [X]: [Short description of the task]**
- Status: [Backlog | In Progress | Done]
- Requirements: [feature-name:FR-XXX], [feature-name:NFR-XXX]
- Test Scenarios: [feature-name:ComponentName/TS-XX], [feature-name:ITS-XX], [feature-name:E2E-XX]
- Details:
  ```
  [details]
  ```

---

## Intermediate Dead Code Tracking

> Code introduced in earlier phases that will be used in later phases must be tracked here.
> All entries must be resolved (code used or removed) by the final phase.

**DC-XX: [Component or code name]**
- Reason: [Why this dead code exists]
- Status: [Pending | Resolved]

---

## Intermediate Stub Tracking

> **CRITICAL: Stubs are NOT acceptable without explicit tracking.**
> All stubs MUST be fully implemented as part of the task that introduces the code they test.
> If a stub is absolutely necessary (e.g., external dependency not yet available), it MUST be tracked here.
> All entries must be resolved (stub implemented or removed) by the final phase.
> A "stub" includes: `skip`, `todo`, `pass`, `pytest.mark.skip`, `@unittest.skip`, `it.skip`, `xit`, `pending`, empty test bodies, or `assert True` placeholders.

**ST-XX: [Test name]**
- Reason: [Why this stub exists]
- Status: [Pending | Resolved]

---

## Requirements Validation

> Bidirectional traceability: Every requirement maps to tasks, and every task specifies its requirements.

- [feature-name:FR-001]
  - Phase [X] Task [Y]
  - Phase [Y] Task [Z]
- [feature-name:FR-002]
  - Phase [X] Task [Y]
  - Phase [Y] Task [Z]

- [feature-name:NFR-001]
  - Phase [X] Task [Y]
  - Phase [Y] Task [Z]
- [feature-name:NFR-002]
  - Phase [X] Task [Y]
  - Phase [Y] Task [Z]

---

## Test Scenario Validation

> Every test scenario must be assigned to at least one task. No orphan scenarios allowed.

### Component Scenarios
- [feature-name:ComponentName/TS-01]: Phase [X] Task [Y]
- [feature-name:ComponentName/TS-02]: Phase [X] Task [Y]

### Integration Scenarios
- [feature-name:ITS-01]: Phase [X] Task [Y]
- [feature-name:ITS-02]: Phase [X] Task [Y]

### E2E Scenarios
- [feature-name:E2E-01]: Phase [X] Task [Y]
- [feature-name:E2E-02]: Phase [X] Task [Y]
