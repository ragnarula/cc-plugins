# Risk Assessment Frameworks

## Purpose

This skill provides systematic frameworks for identifying, evaluating, and quantifying investment risks. Apply these methods to assess downside scenarios, identify red flags, and ensure adequate margin of safety when analyzing potential investments.

## Core Philosophy

Successful investing is about avoiding losses, not maximizing gains. Comprehensive risk assessment identifies what could go wrong and estimates potential impact. Focus on understanding downside scenarios before getting excited about upside potential.

**Key principle:** "It's not what you buy, it's what you pay" - but more importantly, "it's what you could lose."

## Five Categories of Investment Risk

### 1. Business Risk

**Definition:** Risks inherent to the company's business model and operations

**Key Questions:**
- Could the business model become obsolete?
- Is the product/service vulnerable to disruption?
- How dependent is success on continued innovation?
- What happens if key assumptions prove wrong?

**Assessment Framework:**

**Product/Service Risks:**
- [ ] Single product concentration (>50% revenue from one product)
- [ ] Short product life cycles requiring constant innovation
- [ ] Technological obsolescence risk
- [ ] Regulatory approval dependency (pharma, medical devices)
- [ ] Fashion/trend dependency

**Customer Risks:**
- [ ] Customer concentration (>20% from single customer)
- [ ] Few large customers vs. many small customers
- [ ] Customers' financial health deteriorating
- [ ] Switching costs declining

- [ ] Lowered guidance or missed targets

## Risk Quantification Framework

### Downside Scenario Analysis

For each investment, model three scenarios:

**Base Case:**
- Most likely outcome given current information
- Use normalized/sustainable economics
- Moderate growth assumptions

**Downside Case:**
- What happens if things go poorly?
- Model business deterioration
- Estimate impact on intrinsic value

**Severe Downside:**
- Worst realistic case (not worst possible)
- Major setback or structural impairment
- Potential permanent capital loss

**Example Framework:**

| Scenario | Probability | Intrinsic Value | Expected Value |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Base | 60% | $100 | $60 |
| Downside | 30% | $60 | $18 |
| Severe | 10% | $30 | $3 |
| **Expected Value** | | | **$81** |

**Margin of Safety Required:**
- If current price $60, margin = ($81-$60)/$81 = 26% ✓
- If current price $75, margin = ($81-$75)/$81 = 7% ✗ Insufficient

### Stress Testing

Test investment thesis against adverse scenarios:

**Business Stress Tests:**
- Revenue declines 20% - What happens to FCF?
- Margins compress to industry average - Still attractive?
- Market share loss to new competitor - Recoverable?
- Key customer lost - Survivable?

**Financial Stress Tests:**
- Interest rates rise 300bp - Can service debt?
- Recession scenario - Maintains liquidity?
- Credit markets freeze - Can refinance?
- Working capital increases 50% - Have cash?

**Competitive Stress Tests:**
- New well-funded competitor enters - Still profitable?
- Technology disrupts business model - Have response?
- Price war erupts - Can maintain share profitably?

### Maximum Loss Estimation

**Permanent Capital Loss Risk:**
- What's maximum realistic loss if thesis completely wrong?
- Could lose 100% (bankruptcy)?
- Could lose 50% (severe business impairment)?
- Could lose 25% (temporary setback)?

**Factors Affecting Maximum Loss:**
- Asset backing (tangible book value, liquidation value)
- Debt levels (equity wiped out first)
- Business stability (recession-proof vs. cyclical)
- Management quality (ability to navigate crisis)

**Position Sizing:**
- High conviction, low risk: 5-10% of portfolio
- Moderate conviction, moderate risk: 2-5%
- Lower conviction, higher risk: <2%
- Unacceptable risk: 0% (pass entirely)

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Margin of Safety:**
- Wider moat → smaller margin needed (25%)
- Narrower moat → larger margin needed (40-50%)
- No moat → pass regardless of price

**Diversification:**
- Across industries (reduce sector risk)
- Across business models (reduce model risk)
- Across geographies (reduce country risk)
- But don't over-diversify (reduces returns, increases complexity)

**Monitoring:**
- Quarterly financial reviews
- Industry news and competitive developments
- Management changes or strategic shifts
- Red flag escalation (reassess if new flags emerge)

**Exit Criteria:**
- Thesis invalidated (facts changed)
- Better opportunity (opportunity cost)
- Risk profile changed materially
- Price exceeded intrinsic value significantly

## Risk Assessment Process

### Step 1: Identify All Risks

Go through each category systematically:
- Business risks
- Financial risks
- Competitive risks
- Management risks
- Macro risks

Use checklists to ensure nothing missed.

### Step 2: Assess Severity & Probability

For each identified risk:
- **Severity:** High / Medium / Low impact on intrinsic value
- **Probability:** High (>50%) / Medium (20-50%) / Low (<20%)

**Priority Matrix:**
- High severity + High probability = Critical risk
- High severity + Low probability = Monitor closely
- Low severity + High probability = Accept
- Low severity + Low probability = Ignore

### Step 3: Quantify Impact

Model impact of key risks:
- Calculate downside scenario intrinsic values
- Estimate probability-weighted expected value
- Determine required margin of safety

### Step 4: Compare to Upside

**Expected Value Framework:**
- Probability-weighted upside scenarios
- Probability-weighted downside scenarios
- Expected value vs. current price

**Asymmetry Check:**
- Is upside 2-3x larger than downside?
- If lose, how much? If win, how much?
- Favorable vs. unfavorable asymmetry

### Step 5: Make Decision

**Proceed if:**
- Downside protected by margin of safety
- Probability-weighted return attractive (>15% annual)
- Risk/reward asymmetry favorable (2:1 or better)
- Can monitor and manage risks

**Pass if:**
- Any automatic disqualifiers present
- Downside too severe relative to upside
- Too many unknowns or uncertainties
- Better opportunities available

### Example Files

Risk assessment templates:
- **`examples/risk-matrix-template.md`** - Comprehensive risk identification and scoring framework

## Referencing and Source Attribution

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** All risk assessments must include proper source citations for every identified risk, claim, and data point.

### Why Referencing Matters in Risk Assessment

- **Prevents speculation:** Risk claims must be factual, not hypothetical fears
- **Enables validation:** Others can verify risk exists and severity is accurate
- **Distinguishes real from imagined risks:** Sourced risks are credible, unsourced are guesses
- **Supports monitoring:** Clear sources facilitate tracking whether risks materialize
- **Builds decision confidence:** Well-documented risks inform position sizing and margin requirements

### What Requires Citations

**All risk-related claims must be cited:**
- Identified risks from company disclosures (10-K Risk Factors section)
- Competitive threats and market share data
- Regulatory or legal proceedings
- Management changes or governance issues
- Customer concentration or dependencies
- Debt levels, covenants, and maturity schedules
- Industry trends and disruption threats
- Financial stress test inputs (revenue, margins, debt metrics)
- Scenario probabilities and assumptions

**No exceptions:** Every risk claim requires a verifiable source or explicit acknowledgment that it's an analyst judgment.

### Citation Format for Risk Assessment

**Disclosed risks (from SEC filings):**
```markdown
Customer concentration risk: Single customer represents 23% of revenue (Risk Factors, 10-K FY2025, page 15)
Regulatory risk: FDA approval required for lead product; approval uncertain (Risk Factors, 10-K FY2025, page 18)
Debt maturity: $2.5B debt matures in next 18 months (Note 8, 10-K FY2025, page 67)
```

**Competitive and market risks:**
```markdown
Market share loss: Company share declined from 34% (2023) to 28% (2025) (Company 10-K, industry reports from Gartner)
New entrant threat: Three well-funded startups launched competing products in Q3 2025 (TechCrunch, Bloomberg)
Disruption risk: Cloud-based alternatives growing 40% annually vs. company's on-premise model declining 5% (IDC Cloud Infrastructure Report, Q4 2025)
```

**Management and governance risks:**
```markdown
Management turnover: CFO departed September 2025, third CFO in 18 months (8-K filing, September 15, 2025)
Insider selling: CEO sold 50% of holdings in Q3 2025 (Form 4 filings, SEC EDGAR)
Low insider ownership: Executives own <1% of shares (Proxy Statement DEF 14A, 2025, page 24)
```

**Financial and accounting risks:**
```markdown
Covenant risk: Debt covenant requires Debt/EBITDA <3.5x; currently 3.2x (Credit Agreement, 10-K FY2025, Exhibit 10.1)
Accounting irregularities: Revenue recognition policy changed twice in 24 months (10-K FY2024 and FY2025, Note 2)
Working capital deterioration: DSO increased from 45 days (2023) to 68 days (2025) (calculated from 10-K filings)
```

### Analyst Judgments vs. Documented Risks

**Distinguish between documented facts and analyst assessments:**

**Documented fact (cite source):**
```markdown
✅ Debt matures December 2026: $1.8B (10-K FY2025, Note 8, page 72)
```

**Analyst judgment (label clearly):**
```markdown
✅ Refinancing risk assessment: Given company's declining cash flow and deteriorating credit metrics, refinancing this debt may require higher rates or asset sales. [Analyst judgment based on debt maturity schedule (10-K FY2025) and FCF trend analysis]
```

**Never present judgment as fact:**
```markdown
❌ Company will face refinancing challenges (unsourced claim presented as fact)
```

### Stress Test and Scenario Documentation

**All stress test assumptions must be documented:**

```markdown
Revenue Decline Stress Test:
- Base case revenue: $5.2B (10-K FY2025)
- Stress scenario: 20% decline to $4.16B
- Rationale: Historical worst year-over-year decline was 18% during 2008-2009 recession (10-K FY2009)
- Impact on FCF: Falls from $850M to $340M based on 65% variable cost structure (calculated from 10-K cost breakdown)
```

**Scenario probabilities must be justified:**
```markdown
Downside Scenario (30% probability):
- Assigned based on: (1) Historical occurrence of similar events in industry (3 times in 10 years per industry data), (2) Current competitive dynamics, (3) Management execution track record
- Not a precise calculation; represents analyst judgment of likelihood
```

### Sources Section Requirements

Every risk assessment document must include comprehensive Sources section:

**Sources**
1. Company 10-K Risk Factors: [Company Name] Annual Report (Form 10-K), FY2025, pages 12-22 - SEC EDGAR
2. Credit Agreement: Note 8 - Long-term Debt, [Company Name] 10-K FY2025, pages 67-72
3. Insider Trading: Form 4 filings for CEO, CFO, COO - SEC EDGAR, Q3 2025
4. Market Share Data: Gartner Industry Analysis Report, Q4 2025
5. Competitive Intelligence: Bloomberg article "New Entrants Disrupting Industry," November 2025
6. Industry Trends: IDC Cloud Infrastructure Forecast, 2025-2030
7. Historical Financial Performance: [Company Name] 10-K filings FY2015-2025

### Acceptable Source Hierarchy for Risks

**PRIMARY SOURCES (use these first):**
1. SEC filings - Risk Factors section in 10-K
2. SEC filings - Legal proceedings (Item 3 in 10-K, 8-K disclosures)
3. SEC filings - Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A)
4. SEC filings - Insider trading (Form 4, Schedule 13D/G)
5. Credit agreements and debt documentation (10-K exhibits)
6. Earnings calls and investor presentations (for forward-looking risks)

**SECONDARY SOURCES (use when primary unavailable):**
1. Industry research reports (Gartner, IDC, Forrester)
2. Reputable business publications (WSJ, FT, Bloomberg)
3. Regulatory filings (FDA, FTC, DOJ announcements)
4. Credit rating agency reports (Moody's, S&P, Fitch)
5. Competitor disclosures and filings

**ANALYST JUDGMENTS (clearly labeled):**
1. Competitive response scenarios (based on historical patterns)
2. Probability assignments for scenarios
3. Severity assessments (High/Medium/Low)
4. Downside valuation estimates

**UNACCEPTABLE:**
- Unsourced speculation about risks
- Social media rumors or message board discussions
- "Everyone knows" claims without documentation
- Competitor promotional materials as sole source
- Outdated data without verification of current status

### Red Flag Documentation

**Each red flag must cite specific evidence:**

```markdown
✅ Accounting restatement: Company restated FY2024 revenue down 8% due to improper recognition (8-K filing, March 15, 2025, Item 4.02)

✅ Declining returns: ROE fell from 22% (FY2022) to 14% (FY2025) (calculated from 10-K filings FY2022-2025)

✅ Customer concentration: Top customer represents 34% of revenue (10-K FY2025, Note 15, page 89)

❌ Management integrity concerns (no supporting evidence cited)
```

### Quality Standards for Risk Assessment

**Complete risk citation includes:**
- ✅ Specific risk identified
- ✅ Source document (10-K, 8-K, industry report)
- ✅ Specific location (page number, note number, section)
- ✅ Quantification where possible (percentages, amounts, dates)
- ✅ Clear distinction between facts and analyst judgments

**Incomplete risk citation (not acceptable):**
- ❌ "Company has debt concerns" (vague, unsourced)
- ❌ "Management issues" (no specifics, no source)
- ❌ "Industry facing disruption" (no evidence, no source)
- ❌ "High customer concentration" (no quantification, no source)

### Handling Absence of Disclosed Risks

**If a risk exists but company hasn't disclosed it:**

```markdown
Undisclosed concentration risk: Analysis of revenue by customer (Note 15, 10-K FY2025) reveals 45% concentration in top 3 customers, yet Risk Factors section does not identify customer concentration as a risk. [Analyst observation based on financial statement note analysis]
```

This documents both the risk (with source) and the concerning lack of disclosure.

## Summary

Comprehensive risk assessment is the cornerstone of value investing. Focus on:

1. **Systematic identification** - Use checklists to find all risks across five categories
2. **Honest evaluation** - Don't rationalize away concerns
3. **Quantification** - Model downside scenarios, not just upside
4. **Margin of safety** - Require larger buffer when risks higher
5. **Monitoring** - Watch for new risks emerging or existing risks materializing
6. **Complete documentation** - Cite sources for every risk claim and data point

Remember Buffett's rules:
- **Rule #1:** Don't lose money
- **Rule #2:** Don't forget rule #1

Thorough risk assessment with rigorous documentation ensures compliance with both rules.
