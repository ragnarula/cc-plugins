# What to Avoid: Toads, Headwinds, and Institutional Imperatives

Knowing what to avoid is as important as knowing what to buy in value investing. Buffett's colorful warning "don't kiss toads" captures the futility of buying poor businesses hoping for transformation - as he learned, "I kissed and they croaked." The importance of avoiding businesses with structural headwinds cannot be overstated; even exceptional management cannot overcome terrible industry economics, as Berkshire's textile operations proved. Institutional imperatives - the tendency of organizations to do what others are doing regardless of rationality - represent another crucial trap, as exemplified by banks that expanded recklessly because competitors were expanding. Additionally, investors must avoid the "frog-kissing princess" syndrome where managers pay dearly for acquisitions expecting "wondrous transfigurations" that never occur, and they must resist the pull of complex financial engineering that obscures rather than manages risk. The discipline to say "no" to attractive-seeming but fundamentally flawed opportunities separates successful long-term investors from the crowd.

## Examples of Following This Principle

**Avoiding Technology (Until Competence Developed)**: For decades, Buffett avoided technology investments, explicitly stating they fell outside his circle of competence. This avoided spectacular losses during the dot-com crash. Only when he could understand the business model and competitive position with confidence (Apple as a consumer products company with ecosystem lock-in) did he invest.

**Walking Away from Overpriced Deals**: Munger and Buffett's willingness to let other bidders win auctions when prices exceeded rational levels demonstrates discipline. They'd rather do nothing than overpay, even if it means years without major acquisitions. The Blue Chip Stamps example - finding only three deals in decades - shows this patience.

**Exiting Textiles**: Eventually, Berkshire completely exited the textile business rather than continuing to throw good money after bad. This willingness to admit a mistake and move on (rather than doubling down) prevented decades of value destruction.

**Avoiding Derivatives**: Buffett famously called derivatives "financial weapons of mass destruction" and generally avoided them. This saved Berkshire from the catastrophic losses that destroyed many financial institutions in 2008. The complexity of derivatives made risk assessment nearly impossible, violating the principle of understanding what you own.

## Anti-Examples: What NOT Following This Principle Looks Like

**Dexter Shoes - Kissing a Toad**: Buffett's self-described "worst deal ever" perfectly illustrates kissing toads. He paid $434 million in Berkshire stock for a shoe company that appeared profitable but had no sustainable competitive advantage. When overseas competition intensified, Dexter collapsed. He compounded the error by using Berkshire stock (now worth vastly more) for payment. "I gave away 1.6% of a wonderful business – one now valued at $220 billion – to buy a worthless business."

**Continuing Investment in Textiles**: For years, Berkshire continued investing in textile operations despite terrible economics. This violated the principle because "one of the lessons your management has learned... is the importance of being in businesses where tailwinds prevail rather than headwinds." Even very good management couldn't overcome structural challenges.

**Bank Expansion in Heat**: Buffett describes banks whose management became "visibly in heat" during expansion frenzies and "quickly capitulated" to competitive pressure. These banks made irrational loans and acquisitions simply because competitors were doing so - a classic institutional imperative violation that led to disaster.

**1990s Diversification Fads**: Many excellent companies in the 1960s-1980s pursued conglomeration, buying unrelated businesses to "diversify" and "smooth earnings." This typically destroyed value as management teams operated businesses they didn't understand. The subsequent breakup wave in the 1990s-2000s as these conglomerates were dismantled proved the strategy's failure.

**Long-Term Capital Management**: The hedge fund violated virtually every "what to avoid" principle: extreme leverage, incredible complexity (derivatives models only PhDs could understand), overconfidence in quantitative models, and belief that diversification eliminated risk. When correlations broke down in 1998, the fund nearly triggered systemic collapse and was wiped out.

**Enron**: The energy company that became a derivatives trading operation exemplifies multiple avoidance principles. The business became incomprehensible even to sophisticated analysts (complexity), used accounting gimmicks (dishonest management), employed massive leverage, and relied on continuous market access. The transformation from understandable utility to complex financial entity should have been a massive red flag.

**AOL-Time Warner**: The $165 billion merger epitomized the "wondrous transformation" fantasy - that combining old media with new would create synergy. Instead, it destroyed over $100 billion in shareholder value. This violated multiple principles: paying premium prices with overvalued stock, pursuing size over value, ignoring cultural/business model incompatibility, and following fads (internet mania).

**Pet.com and Dot-Com Failures**: Investors who bought businesses with no path to profitability, no competitive advantages, and valuations based on "eyeballs" and "mindshare" rather than cash flows were kissing toads on an industrial scale. The belief that "this time is different" and traditional valuation didn't apply led to catastrophic losses.

**Investing in Commodities Without Moats**: The investor who buys commodity producers (steel, aluminum, coal, basic chemicals) hoping for high returns typically faces structural headwinds. These businesses have no pricing power, compete purely on cost, require constant reinvestment, and rarely earn above-cost capital. The good years (high commodity prices) lead to overexpansion, ensuring terrible returns overall.

**Following Private Equity Fee Structures**: The limited partner who invests in private equity funds charging "2 and 20" (2% annual fee, 20% of profits) without exceptional returns is violating basic math. Charlie Munger points out that after fees, taxes, and inflation, the investor might keep 30-40% of the gross returns - requiring the fund to be extraordinary just to match market returns. This is kissing a toad (high fees) hoping for transformation.
