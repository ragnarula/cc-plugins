# Management Quality: Integrity, Competence, and Owner-Orientation

The quality of management is paramount in value investing, with integrity standing as the most critical attribute - even above competence. Buffett seeks managers who think and act like owners rather than hired agents, who operate with what Justice Cardozo called "the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive," and who build what Munger describes as "a seamless web of deserved trust." Competent management is evidenced by rational capital allocation, honest communication with shareholders, resistance to institutional imperatives (the tendency to do what other companies are doing), and a track record of creating value over time. The ideal manager doesn't require close oversight, makes decisions that benefit shareholders rather than enhancing personal prestige, and communicates both successes and failures candidly. As Munger emphasizes, deserved trust is earned by delivering what you would want if circumstances were reversed - consistently choosing the ethical path even when it's costly.

## Examples of Following This Principle

**Berkshire's Operating Managers**: Buffett repeatedly praises managers like the Blumkins (Nebraska Furniture Mart), who operated with complete integrity, thought like owners because they were owners, and needed no oversight. Mrs. B famously worked until age 103, demonstrating that when managers truly care about the business (not just compensation), they create extraordinary value.

**Ajit Jain at Berkshire Reinsurance**: Demonstrated exceptional competence in underwriting while maintaining complete integrity. He would walk away from business that didn't make sense, even when it meant lower volume and potentially lower bonuses in the short term. This long-term thinking aligned perfectly with shareholder interests.

**Owner-Operated Businesses**: See's Candy under the original family ownership exemplified owner-orientation. They obsessed over quality because it was their name and reputation at stake, not because of contractual obligations. They made expensive decisions (natural ingredients, quality control, cheerful service) that enhanced long-term value even when cheaper alternatives existed.

**Capital Cities/ABC Management**: Tom Murphy and Dan Burke, whom Buffett called "the best management team in the media industry," demonstrated owner-orientation despite running a public company. They made decisions based on business logic rather than Wall Street expectations, communicated honestly, and allocated capital rationally rather than empire-building.

## Anti-Examples: What NOT Following This Principle Looks Like

**The "Frog-Kissing Princess" Syndrome**: Buffett describes managers who pursue acquisitions or strategies that increase corporate size or prestige but destroy shareholder value. These managers pay ridiculous prices for acquisitions hoping for "wondrous transfigurations" that never occur. The motivation is personal (bigger empire, more prestige, higher compensation) rather than shareholder value creation.

**Institutional Imperatives**: The bank expansion example where management "visibly in heat" capitulated to competitive pressure and made irrational expansion decisions simply because competitors were expanding. Rather than thinking independently about what made sense for shareholders, they followed the herd - a failure of both competence and courage.

**Aggressive Accounting and Misleading Communication**: Managers who use accounting gimmickry to meet earnings targets, who highlight non-GAAP metrics that obscure reality, or who blame every disappointment on external factors while claiming credit for every success. This behavior prioritizes personal compensation (often tied to quarterly metrics) over honest dealing with shareholders.

**Empire Building Over Value Creation**: The executive who pursues major acquisitions primarily to run a larger company (with corresponding prestige and compensation) rather than because the acquisition makes economic sense. This often manifests in paying premium prices, issuing excessive stock, or entering businesses outside the circle of competence.

**Excessive Compensation and Perks**: Management that grants itself enormous compensation packages unrelated to actual performance, uses corporate jets for personal travel, or engages in other self-dealing. This signals that managers view the company as a vehicle for personal enrichment rather than as a trust to be managed for shareholders.

**Refusal to Acknowledge Mistakes**: The manager who never admits errors, always blames external factors for poor performance, and refuses to learn from failures. Munger's principle that "any year you don't destroy one of your best-loved ideas is a wasted year" is violated by managers who stubbornly defend failing strategies to protect their egos.

**Following Fads**: Management that adopts every trendy strategy - aggressive M&A in the 1980s, dot-com ventures in the late 1990s, crypto/blockchain in 2017-2021 - regardless of whether it makes sense for their specific business. This demonstrates lack of independent thinking and susceptibility to social proof rather than rational analysis.
