# Valuation Approaches: Intrinsic Value Over Market Price

The cornerstone of value investing valuation is intrinsic value - the discounted present value of all future cash flows that can be extracted from a business. Buffett defines intrinsic value as "the figure indicating what all of our constituent businesses are rationally worth... taking all future cash flows of a business - in and out - and discounting them." While precise calculation is impossible (requiring perfect foresight), the concept provides a rational framework for thinking about what a business is truly worth independent of market price. Book value serves as a "conservative, but useful, proxy" for intrinsic value, particularly for Berkshire where retained earnings are reinvested at high rates of return. The concept of "look-through earnings" extends traditional accounting by including the investor's share of retained earnings from investees, providing a more complete picture of economic value creation. The key insight is that price and value are not the same - price is what you pay, value is what you get - and the intelligent investor focuses on the latter.

## Examples of Following This Principle

**Coca-Cola Valuation**: Buffett didn't buy Coca-Cola because it was cheap by traditional metrics like P/E ratio. He bought it because he could estimate its future cash flows with reasonable confidence given the business's stability, pricing power, and global growth potential. The brand's durability meant those future cash flows were highly predictable, justifying a premium price that still represented a discount to intrinsic value.

**Look-Through Earnings**: Berkshire's look-through earnings approach captures the reality that when Coca-Cola or See's Candy retain earnings and reinvest them at high rates of return, this creates value for Berkshire even though it doesn't appear in GAAP earnings. If See's retains $10 million and can reinvest it at 25% returns, that's more valuable than $10 million in dividends that must be reinvested at lower rates.

**Book Value as Proxy**: For Berkshire specifically, book value serves as a reasonable proxy for intrinsic value because: (1) insurance float is carried at no cost but has value; (2) many investments are carried at cost despite appreciation; (3) retained earnings have historically been reinvested at rates well above average. Thus, growth in book value approximates growth in intrinsic value.

**See's Candy Acquisition**: Buffett paid $25 million for a business with only $8 million in net tangible assets - a huge premium by traditional value metrics. However, he recognized that the economic franchise was worth far more than the tangible assets. The ability to generate $4+ million in earnings with minimal capital requirements meant the true intrinsic value far exceeded both price paid and book value.

## Anti-Examples: What NOT Following This Principle Looks Like

**Focusing on P/E Ratios Alone**: The investor who won't buy anything over 15x earnings regardless of quality is missing the point. A wonderful business growing at 15% annually with high returns on capital and a durable moat might be cheap at 30x earnings, while a struggling commodity business at 8x earnings might be expensive. The multiple itself is meaningless without understanding the business underneath.

**Buying Based on Price Targets**: The approach of buying a stock because "analysts have a $100 price target and it's trading at $75" ignores intrinsic value entirely. Analyst price targets are typically based on near-term market sentiment and relative valuation rather than discounted cash flow analysis. The stock might deserve to trade at $50.

**Net-Net Investing in Modern Markets**: The strict Graham approach of buying only stocks trading below net current asset value (working capital minus all liabilities) worked in the 1930s-1950s but often leads to value traps today. These businesses are usually cheap because they're dying - focusing solely on asset value while ignoring earning power and competitive position is a recipe for permanent capital loss.

**Ignoring Economic Reality**: The investor who values a retailer by looking at store real estate values rather than earning power might calculate high "intrinsic value" even as the business loses money and customers flee to online competitors. The assets only have value if they can generate cash flows, and technological obsolescence can make seemingly valuable assets worthless.

**Short-Term Earnings Focus**: Valuing a business based solely on current or next year's earnings without considering sustainability, competitive position, or reinvestment needs. For example, valuing an oil producer based on current oil prices and production without considering depletion, reinvestment requirements, or commodity price cycles leads to massive valuation errors.

**Market-Based Valuation**: Using the market price of comparable companies as the primary valuation method (comps) rather than intrinsic value. If the entire sector is overvalued, buying because "we're getting it cheaper than competitors" still means overpaying. The "cheapest house in an expensive neighborhood" approach ignores absolute value.

**Ignoring Quality in DCF**: Running a discounted cash flow model with aggressive growth assumptions or inappropriately low discount rates to justify a desired purchase. The discipline of intrinsic value requires conservative assumptions, especially for businesses without proven durability. Garbage in, garbage out - a mathematically precise DCF model with unrealistic assumptions is worthless.
