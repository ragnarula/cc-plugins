# Good Business Criteria: Quality Over Cheapness

A fundamental principle of value investing is that it's far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a mediocre business at a bargain price. The ideal business possesses what Buffett calls an "economic franchise" - a product or service that customers need or desire, perceive as having no close substitute, and which is not subject to price regulation. These businesses can generate high returns on equity capital consistently over time, and critically, they can tolerate management mistakes without suffering permanent damage. The evolution from Graham's cigar-butt approach (buying cheap, mediocre businesses) to the Munger-influenced quality approach represents one of the most important shifts in value investing philosophy. As Buffett learned, mediocre businesses require constant managerial excellence just to achieve modest results, while great businesses can produce excellent results even with average management.

## Examples of Following This Principle

**See's Candy**: Perhaps the perfect example of an economic franchise. Customers exhibited "virtually fanatic" loyalty, preferring See's candy to all others despite premium pricing. The business could raise prices 10-15% annually without losing customers because the product was perceived as unique and irreplaceable, especially during gift-giving occasions. This pricing power combined with efficient operations produced extraordinary returns on capital.

**Coca-Cola**: Represents the ultimate economic franchise with a "powerful worldwide brand" that customers view as having no substitute. The business generates returns far exceeding its tangible asset base because the brand itself - an intangible asset - creates immense value. Buffett called it "the most valuable franchise in the world" and was willing to pay a premium price for ownership.

**GEICO**: Demonstrates the low-cost producer moat. By operating with dramatically lower costs than traditional insurance agencies (no agent commissions), GEICO could offer lower prices while maintaining superior profitability. This structural cost advantage created a durable competitive position that protected high returns on capital.

## Anti-Examples: What NOT Following This Principle Looks Like

**Berkshire's Textile Business**: The quintessential example of a mediocre business that consumed enormous managerial talent for modest results. Despite having some of the best management minds working on it, the business faced structural headwinds (commodity product, strong competition, no pricing power) that prevented good returns. Buffett noted that "even very good management probably can average only modest results" in such businesses.

**Cigar-Butt Investing**: The old Graham approach of buying statistically cheap stocks - companies trading below net current asset value - often meant buying declining or mediocre businesses. While you might get "one free puff" from the cheap price, these businesses typically had poor economics and no sustainable competitive advantages. The cheap price was cheap for good reason.

**Dexter Shoes Acquisition**: Buffett's famous mistake of buying what seemed like a good business (profitable shoe manufacturer) but which turned out to have no durable competitive advantage. Once competition from international manufacturers intensified, Dexter had no moat to protect its position. Buffett compounded the error by paying with Berkshire stock, giving away a piece of a wonderful business for a mediocre one.

**Airlines (historically)**: For decades, Buffett pointed to airlines as the opposite of good businesses - high capital requirements, commodity-like service, powerful suppliers (labor unions, aircraft manufacturers), and no customer loyalty. The industry earned terrible returns despite enormous amounts of invested capital. This changed somewhat with industry consolidation, but historically airlines represented everything NOT to look for in a business.

**Retailers Without Differentiation**: Traditional department stores or retailers without a unique value proposition face constant competitive pressure. When any competitor can replicate your offering, you're forced to compete on price, which destroys returns on capital. These businesses require constant reinvestment just to maintain position, unlike franchises that can generate cash while strengthening.
