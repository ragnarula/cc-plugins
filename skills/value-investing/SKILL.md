# Value Investing Principles

## Purpose

This skill provides the foundational principles, mental models, and frameworks used by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger for evaluating long-term investments. Apply these principles to assess business quality, identify competitive advantages, and avoid value traps when analyzing publicly traded companies.

## Core Philosophy

Value investing prioritizes avoiding losses over chasing gains. Focus on understanding what a business is worth (intrinsic value) and purchasing it at a significant discount (margin of safety). The goal is not to find good investments, but to avoid bad ones.

### Key Principles

1. **Circle of Competence** - Only invest in businesses that can be fully understood
2. **Margin of Safety** - Require significant discount between price and intrinsic value (typically 25-50%)
3. **Business Quality Over Price** - Better to pay fair price for wonderful company than wonderful price for fair company
4. **Long-term Thinking** - Hold forever if business quality remains excellent
5. **Management Quality** - Invest with honest, competent managers who think like owners

## The Four Essential Questions

When evaluating any investment opportunity, answer these four questions in order:

### 1. Can I Understand This Business?

**Circle of competence check:**
- Explain the business model in simple terms
- Identify how the company makes money
- Understand the products/services and customer value proposition
- Know the competitive landscape

**Red flags for complexity:**
- Business model requires extensive technical knowledge outside expertise
- Revenue sources are opaque or constantly changing
- Management uses jargon to explain operations
- Cannot predict what business will look like in 10 years

**Action:** If the business cannot be understood clearly, stop analysis and move to next opportunity. No shame in saying "I don't know."

### 2. Does This Business Have Favorable Long-term Economics?

**Economic moat assessment:**

Identify durable competitive advantages that protect profitability:

- **Brand Power** - Customers pay premium or exhibit strong loyalty (Coca-Cola, Apple)
- **Network Effects** - Value increases as more users join (Visa, Mastercard)
- **Cost Advantages** - Structural cost leadership competitors cannot replicate (Costco, Geico)
- **Switching Costs** - High friction prevents customers from leaving (Bloomberg terminals, enterprise software)
- **Intangible Assets** - Patents, licenses, regulatory approvals create barriers (pharma patents, banking licenses)

**Key metrics to evaluate:**
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Consistently >15% indicates strong economics
- **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**: Consistently >12% shows efficient capital deployment
- **Profit Margins**: Stable or expanding margins demonstrate pricing power
- **Free Cash Flow**: Strong and growing FCF indicates real earnings quality

**Red flags:**
- Commoditized products with no differentiation
- High capital intensity with low returns
- Declining margins despite revenue growth
- Negative or inconsistent free cash flow
- Heavy reliance on acquisitions for growth

**Action:** Businesses without durable competitive advantages rarely maintain strong returns. Proceed only if clear moat exists.

### 3. Is Management Both Able and Trustworthy?

**Management evaluation framework:**

**Ability (competence):**
- Capital allocation track record - Do they make smart investments, acquisitions, buybacks?
- Operating performance - Do they consistently meet or exceed stated goals?
- Industry expertise - Do they deeply understand their business?
- Long-term thinking - Do they sacrifice short-term earnings for long-term value?

**Trustworthiness (integrity):**
- Shareholder letters - Are they candid about problems and mistakes?
- Compensation - Is executive pay reasonable and aligned with long-term performance?
- Share ownership - Do executives own significant personal stakes?
- Related-party transactions - Any self-dealing or conflicts of interest?
- Accounting choices - Do they use conservative accounting or aggressive practices?

**Red flags:**
- Frequent restatements or accounting changes
- Excessive executive compensation relative to results
- Acquisitions at inflated prices to boost short-term metrics
- Overly promotional language without substance
- Lack of management share ownership
- History of overpromising and underdelivering

**Buffett's rule:** "When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact."

**Action:** Even great businesses can be destroyed by poor management. Pass on companies with questionable management, regardless of business quality.

### 4. What Is It Worth and What Is the Margin of Safety?

**Valuation approaches:**

Use multiple methods to triangulate intrinsic value:

1. **Owner Earnings Capitalization** - Normalize owner earnings (net income + depreciation - capex - working capital needs), apply appropriate capitalization rate
2. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** - Project free cash flows conservatively, discount at 10-12%
3. **Relative Valuation** - Compare to similar high-quality businesses, adjust for differences
4. **Asset-Based** - For asset-heavy businesses, assess liquidation value and replacement cost

**Conservative assumptions:**
- Use normalized earnings (average across cycle, adjust for one-time items)
- Apply high discount rates (10% minimum, higher for riskier businesses)
- Use pessimistic growth assumptions (GDP growth or less for mature companies)
- Assume margins revert to industry average unless moat is exceptional
- Extend projections only as far as visibility allows (typically 5-10 years)

**Margin of safety requirement:**

The gap between intrinsic value and purchase price protects against:
- Errors in valuation analysis
- Unforeseen business deterioration
- Market fluctuations
- Bad luck

**Required margin of safety:**
- Exceptional businesses (wide moat, great management): 25% minimum
- Good businesses (narrow moat, decent management): 40% minimum
- Fair businesses (no moat, adequate management): Avoid entirely

**Action:** Only purchase when market price provides adequate margin of safety. Otherwise, watch and wait.

## Mental Models for Investment Analysis

### Inversion

Instead of asking "Why should I buy this?", ask "What could go wrong?" and "How could I lose money?"

**Application:**
- List all ways the investment thesis could fail
- Identify key dependencies and what happens if they break
- Consider worst-case scenarios, not just base case
- Work backward from potential losses to identify red flags

### Second-Order Thinking

Consider consequences of consequences, not just immediate effects.

**Application:**
- If company gains market share, what do competitors do?
- If margins expand, what does that attract?
- If business model succeeds, what regulations might emerge?
- If management executes perfectly, what changes in 5-10 years?

### Opportunity Cost

Every investment competes with every other potential use of capital.

**Application:**
- Compare to owning index fund (10% expected annual return)
- Compare to best alternative specific investment
- Consider if capital is better deployed waiting for better opportunity
- Factor in taxes and transaction costs of switching

### Lollapalooza Effect

Multiple factors working together create non-linear outcomes.

**Application:**
- Identify when several positive factors converge (strong moat + great management + undervaluation)
- Recognize when multiple negative factors compound (deteriorating business + poor management + overvaluation)
- Understand that mediocre on all dimensions rarely leads to outstanding results

## Common Value Traps to Avoid

### The Cigar Butt

**Trap:** Cheap valuation on declining business
**Why it fails:** Last puff may not be worth the price; business deterioration accelerates
**How to avoid:** Require stable or improving fundamentals, not just low multiples

### The Growth Story

**Trap:** Paying high multiple for projected future growth
**Why it fails:** Growth rarely materializes as expected; high expectations leave no margin for error
**How to avoid:** Only pay for demonstrated earnings, not projected earnings

### The Turnaround

**Trap:** Betting on business transformation or new management fix
**Why it fails:** Turnarounds rarely work; business problems often run deeper than apparent
**How to avoid:** Require clear evidence of improvement, not hope for change

### The "Everyone Knows" Business

**Trap:** Popular consensus picks that "can't lose"
**Why it fails:** All good news already priced in; any disappointment causes sharp repricing
**How to avoid:** Skeptical of consensus; best opportunities come when others are fearful

### The Too-Complex Special Situation

**Trap:** Complicated corporate restructurings, spinoffs, special dividends
**Why it fails:** Complexity hides risk; hard to model accurately
**How to avoid:** Stick to straightforward businesses with clear value propositions
