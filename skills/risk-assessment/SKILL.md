# Risk Assessment Frameworks

## Purpose

This skill provides systematic frameworks for identifying, evaluating, and quantifying investment risks. Apply these methods to assess downside scenarios, identify red flags, and ensure adequate margin of safety when analyzing potential investments.

## Core Philosophy

Successful investing is about avoiding losses, not maximizing gains. Comprehensive risk assessment identifies what could go wrong and estimates potential impact. Focus on understanding downside scenarios before getting excited about upside potential.

**Key principle:** "It's not what you buy, it's what you pay" - but more importantly, "it's what you could lose."

## Five Categories of Investment Risk

### 1. Business Risk

**Definition:** Risks inherent to the company's business model and operations

**Key Questions:**
- Could the business model become obsolete?
- Is the product/service vulnerable to disruption?
- How dependent is success on continued innovation?
- What happens if key assumptions prove wrong?

**Assessment Framework:**

**Product/Service Risks:**
- [ ] Single product concentration (>50% revenue from one product)
- [ ] Short product life cycles requiring constant innovation
- [ ] Technological obsolescence risk
- [ ] Regulatory approval dependency (pharma, medical devices)
- [ ] Fashion/trend dependency

**Customer Risks:**
- [ ] Customer concentration (>20% from single customer)
- [ ] Few large customers vs. many small customers
- [ ] Customers' financial health deteriorating
- [ ] Switching costs declining
- [ ] Customer consolidation reducing bargaining power

**Supplier Risks:**

### 2. Financial Risk

**Definition:** Risks from capital structure, liquidity, and financial management

**Leverage Risk Assessment:**

**Debt Levels:**

## Risk Quantification Framework

### Downside Scenario Analysis

For each investment, model three scenarios:

**Base Case:**
- Most likely outcome given current information
- Use normalized/sustainable economics
- Moderate growth assumptions

**Downside Case:**
- What happens if things go poorly?
- Model business deterioration
- Estimate impact on intrinsic value

**Severe Downside:**
- Worst realistic case (not worst possible)
- Major setback or structural impairment
- Potential permanent capital loss

**Example Framework:**

| Scenario | Probability | Intrinsic Value | Expected Value |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Base | 60% | $100 | $60 |
| Downside | 30% | $60 | $18 |
| Severe | 10% | $30 | $3 |
| **Expected Value** | | | **$81** |

**Margin of Safety Required:**
- If current price $60, margin = ($81-$60)/$81 = 26% ✓
- If current price $75, margin = ($81-$75)/$81 = 7% ✗ Insufficient

### Stress Testing

Test investment thesis against adverse scenarios:

**Business Stress Tests:**
- Revenue declines 20% - What happens to FCF?
- Margins compress to industry average - Still attractive?
- Market share loss to new competitor - Recoverable?
- Key customer lost - Survivable?

**Financial Stress Tests:**
- Interest rates rise 300bp - Can service debt?
- Recession scenario - Maintains liquidity?
- Credit markets freeze - Can refinance?
- Working capital increases 50% - Have cash?

**Competitive Stress Tests:**
- New well-funded competitor enters - Still profitable?
- Technology disrupts business model - Have response?
- Price war erupts - Can maintain share profitably?

### Maximum Loss Estimation

**Permanent Capital Loss Risk:**
- What's maximum realistic loss if thesis completely wrong?
- Could lose 100% (bankruptcy)?
- Could lose 50% (severe business impairment)?
- Could lose 25% (temporary setback)?

**Factors Affecting Maximum Loss:**
- Asset backing (tangible book value, liquidation value)
- Debt levels (equity wiped out first)
- Business stability (recession-proof vs. cyclical)
- Management quality (ability to navigate crisis)

**Position Sizing:**
- High conviction, low risk: 5-10% of portfolio
- Moderate conviction, moderate risk: 2-5%
- Lower conviction, higher risk: <2%
- Unacceptable risk: 0% (pass entirely)

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Margin of Safety:**
- Wider moat → smaller margin needed (25%)
- Narrower moat → larger margin needed (40-50%)
- No moat → pass regardless of price

**Diversification:**
- Across industries (reduce sector risk)
- Across business models (reduce model risk)
- Across geographies (reduce country risk)
- But don't over-diversify (reduces returns, increases complexity)

**Monitoring:**
- Quarterly financial reviews
- Industry news and competitive developments
- Management changes or strategic shifts
- Red flag escalation (reassess if new flags emerge)

**Exit Criteria:**
- Thesis invalidated (facts changed)
- Better opportunity (opportunity cost)
- Risk profile changed materially
- Price exceeded intrinsic value significantly

## Risk Assessment Process

### Step 1: Identify All Risks

Go through each category systematically:
- Business risks
- Financial risks
- Competitive risks
- Management risks
- Macro risks

Use checklists to ensure nothing missed.

### Step 2: Assess Severity & Probability

For each identified risk:
- **Severity:** High / Medium / Low impact on intrinsic value
- **Probability:** High (>50%) / Medium (20-50%) / Low (<20%)

**Priority Matrix:**
- High severity + High probability = Critical risk
- High severity + Low probability = Monitor closely
- Low severity + High probability = Accept
- Low severity + Low probability = Ignore

### Step 3: Quantify Impact

Model impact of key risks:
- Calculate downside scenario intrinsic values
- Estimate probability-weighted expected value
- Determine required margin of safety

### Step 4: Compare to Upside

**Expected Value Framework:**
- Probability-weighted upside scenarios
- Probability-weighted downside scenarios
- Expected value vs. current price

**Asymmetry Check:**
- Is upside 2-3x larger than downside?
- If lose, how much? If win, how much?
- Favorable vs. unfavorable asymmetry

### Step 5: Make Decision

**Proceed if:**
- Downside protected by margin of safety
- Probability-weighted return attractive (>15% annual)
- Risk/reward asymmetry favorable (2:1 or better)
- Can monitor and manage risks

**Pass if:**
- Any automatic disqualifiers present
- Downside too severe relative to upside
- Too many unknowns or uncertainties
- Better opportunities available

## Summary

Comprehensive risk assessment is the cornerstone of value investing. Focus on:

1. **Systematic identification** - Use checklists to find all risks across five categories
2. **Honest evaluation** - Don't rationalize away concerns
3. **Quantification** - Model downside scenarios, not just upside
4. **Margin of safety** - Require larger buffer when risks higher
5. **Monitoring** - Watch for new risks emerging or existing risks materializing

Remember Buffett's rules:
- **Rule #1:** Don't lose money
- **Rule #2:** Don't forget rule #1

Thorough risk assessment ensures compliance with both rules.
