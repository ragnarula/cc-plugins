# Value Investor Plugin Settings

This file configures your value-investor plugin preferences. Copy this file to `.claude/value-investor.local.md` (without the .example extension) and customize with your preferences.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Copy this file**:
   ```bash
   cp .claude/value-investor.local.md.example .claude/value-investor.local.md
   ```

2. **Add API keys** (optional):

## Important Notes

- The `.local.md` file is in `.gitignore` and won't be committed
